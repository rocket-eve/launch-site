### 25 April 2023

SDO EVE team has decided to add a 90 degree roll during flight at T+370sec to provide additional validation of the alignments between the EVE instruments and the sun position sensors (LISS, MASS, MEGS-SAM, XRS-SPS, PicoSIM-SPS). The prime solar observations for calibrations are near apogee from T+220sec and T+340sec.

### 24 April 2023

Solar alignment post-vibration checks indicate less than 1 arc-minute shifts (requirement is 3 arc-min).
Payload has its final flight inspections and preparations.
